# Spacegray

Spacegray is all about hype and minimal.

## Install

### Manual

* Download the .zip
* Unzip and rename the folder to `Theme - Spacegray`
* Find your `Packages` directory using the menu item `Preferences -> Browse Packages...` in Sublime Text
* Copy the folder into `Packages` directory

## Setup

### UI Theme

* Open your User Settings Preferences file `Preferences -> Settings - User`
* Add (or update) your theme entry to be `"theme": "Spacegray.sublime-theme"`
* Restart Sublime Text

### Color scheme

Spacegray works best and comes with [Base16 Ocean](http://chriskempson.github.io/base16/#ocean) color scheme by Chris Kempson. But you can use it with any other.

Bese16 Ocean is already included in the zip. To use it update your color scheme entry to be `"color_scheme": "Packages/Theme - Spacegray/base16-ocean.dark.tmTheme"`
